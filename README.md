# Project: Digital Transformation (2018 - 2019)

## Overview
Led the functional teams to support Proximity Financeâ€™s digital transformation journey. From the functional perspective, the business required a person who has in-depth knowledge of the entire business, financial industry, regulatory frameworks, business processes in order to support for this project to successfully deliver. I took over the role of acting as a functional lead to support for the project.

## Key Achievements
- **Functional Features**: Collected requirements from business teams to state them clearly in the BRD document, which was later used to define features to design in the core banking system (Musoni).
- **System Versatility**: Closely worked together with functional teams and the solution provider team to ensure the features are designed as requested and overviewed the execution of a 360-degree test, which was done by chosen functional team members.
- **Successfully Transformed**: It took one year and successfully transformed into the new core banking system that reduced paperwork, streamlined credit committee approval for credit products.
- **Data Migration**: Defined data structures and conducted brainstorming sessions with business teams to define required data fields to support better data-driven decision-making mechanisms for the business.
- **Design System Guide**: Overviewed and contributed to design the system guide to ensure the guide clearly stated how the system works, flows are accurate, and user-friendly.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- Musoni cloud-based core banking system
- Presentation
- MS Project Management
- Trello
- Teams
- Scrum framework
- Excel

## Challenges Faced
- **Data Migration**: Data cleaning stage was the most challenging part of the project, as we had unstructured data in the past. However, it was solved by hiring a third-party data engineer who was an expert in the field.
- **Gap Analysis**: Gaps between the onboard system and business requirements were enormous and difficult to manage and get support to build up defined features by the vendors. However, I dealt with the vendor by giving a proper timeframe to build up all the intended features in the new system.
- **Skill Gap for Field Staff**: Field staff had little to no knowledge of the loan management system. It took time to deliver effective training. However, the user guide, an effective training curriculum, and well-trained trainers delivered the results effectively.
- **Vendor Management**: Managing the vendor was one of the most challenging aspects of the project, as we came up with hundreds of system features to improve. However, I overcame the challenge by using the Scrum framework to prioritize tasks, having regular meetings, and defining clear goals.

This project exemplified my expertise in the area of business analysis, cross-functional team collaboration, vendor management, system design and architecture, and democratic leadership.
